Introduction:
Low Carbon Ferro Chrome (LC FeCr) is a vital alloying element in stainless steel manufacturing, where low carbon content and high chromium purity determine product quality. BBMAM specializes in delivering globally compliant LC FeCr for diverse steel industries.
________________


H2: What is Low Carbon Ferro Chrome?
Ferro Chrome is an alloy of chromium and iron, and LC FeCr contains <0.1% carbon, making it ideal for high-performance applications. It is generally produced through aluminothermic or silicothermic reduction.
BBMAM Grades Supplied:
* LC FeCr Lumps

* LC FeCr Granules

* LC FeCr Briquettes (on demand)

________________


H2: Industrial Applications of LC FeCr

H2: Myth vs Fact
                                                                                                               1. Myth: All ferro chrome is the same

 Fact: Grades vary by carbon %, which changes steel properties

                                                                                                               2. Myth: Higher price = better quality

 Fact: Purity, traceability, and composition testing are more reliable indicators

                                                                                                               3. Myth: Ferroalloys can’t expire

 Fact: Exposure to moisture and oxidation can ruin reactivity
